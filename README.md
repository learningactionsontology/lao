# Learning Actions Ontology

The Learning Actions Ontology (LAO) serves as the uniform vocabulary under which all specific learning actions and conditions pertaining to their materialisation can be instantiated. It models a categorisation of generic to more specific types of Learning Actions, along with their semantic relationships with materialisation conditions, such as the learning materials that tangibly execute the learning action for any given type of learning context and agents that can support a given material.
